# Stream One Project

Repository for my Stream One Project

## Introduction

For the basis of this project, I wanted to do something that is worthwhile and that may be of help to someone in some way.  So I decided to choose a local charity that helps homeless people and redesign their website.  The main reason being that I think it could be slightly more contemporary and it was also created using non-responsive design (screen does not always fit the viewpoint of the device it is being viewed on):

**Below Screenshots Show Unresponsive Menu And Text Not Readable To The Right Of The Screen**
